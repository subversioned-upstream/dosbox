DOSBox v0.50

Usage:
======

With the new internal shell I've changed the command line a bit, so let's just give some 
examples of what you can do now.
dosbox 
  With nothing on the command line you'll end up on the internal drive and from there you
  can mount directories as drives.
dosbox [filename/directory]
  If dosbox detects a directory it'll mount that as c:\ and then start the shell.
  If dosbox doesn't detect a directory it'll assume you mean an executable this can be 
  .bat .com .exe. Doesn't need to have extension included. Then it'll strip the directory
  from the filename and mount that as c:\ and then run the file.

You can also add commands to be executed before the main program starts. Or you can use them
to start the program. 
To add commands use the -c command line switch.
For example
dosbox c:\atlantis\atlantis.exe -c "MOUNT D C:\SAVES" "SET TEST=blah"
  This would mount c:\atlanis as c:\ and run atlantis.exe from that directory but before it 
  does that it would first mount C:\SAVES as the D drive and set the environment variable test to blah.

Dragging files or directories onto the DOSBox executable should also work.


Internal Programs:
==================

MOUNT 
Program to mount local directories as drives inside DOSBox.

HWSET
Utility to setup the emulated hardware running inside DOSBox, only working for emulated sound cards.

UPCASE <Linux Version only>
Utility to convert all files subdirectories of a local directory into upcase so DOSBox can use that directory
for mounting. This tool can be quite dangerous if used unproperly. You have been warned.


To get more information about how to use one these programs use the the /? command line switch.


Special Keys:
=============

ALT-ENTER       Go full screen and back.
CTRL-F10        Capture/Release the mouse.
CTRL-F11        Slowdown emulation.
CTRL-F12        Speedup emulation.

System requirements:
====================

Fast machine my guess would be pentium-2 400+ to get decent emulation
of games written for an 286 machine.

FAQ:
====

1.Q: I've got a Z instead of a C at the prompt.
  A: In DOSBox you can mount directories as drives
     in win32: mount c D:\ would give you an C in DOSBox which points
     at D:\ in win32
     in linux: mount c /home/username would give you and C in DOSBox
     which points at /home/username in Linux

2.Q: The window is too small.
  A: When you mouse touches the edges of the DOSBox screen you can click and drag it to 
     the size you prefer.

3. Check the site/forum.
