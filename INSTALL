First of all if you are running a non-x86 machine this will not work,
code only works for big-endian machines for now :)

Things needed for compilation.

SDL 
	The Simple DirectMedia Library available at http://www.libsdl.org

Curses 
	If you want to enable the debugger you need a curses library.
	ncurses should be installed on just about every unix distro.
	For win32 get pdcurses at http://pdcurses.sourceforge.net

If you want compile from the CVS under a unix system, you'll also need 
automake, autoconf. Should be available at http://www.gnu.org

For building on unix systems.
If you are building from the cvs run ./autogen.sh first before doing the following.

1. ./configure
2. Check settings.h for some setup options.
3. make

Check the src subdir for the binary and dosbox.lang file.
These 2 files should be in the same dir if you want to run dosbox.

Compiling on FreeBSD might be a problem since SDL has no joystick support there.
To get around this edit sdlmain.cpp to enable some #define.
Let's hope someday the sdl people will just report 0 joysticks in freebsd or get it working some other way :)


Build instructions for VC++6 

Open the workspace in the visualc subdir and build from there. 
Copy the src/dosbox.lang file to the same dir as your executable.
